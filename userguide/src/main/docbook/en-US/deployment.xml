  <title>Deployment</title>

  <para>jPDL is an embeddable BPM engine, which means that you can take the jPDL 
    libraries and embed it into your own Java project, rather then installing a separate product
    and integrate with it.  One of the key aspects that make this possible is 
    minimizing the dependencies.  This chapter discusses the jbpm libraries and 
    their dependencies.

    <para>All the libraries on which jPDL might have a dependency, are located in 
      the lib directory.  The actual version of those libraries might depend 
      on the JBoss server that you've selected in the installer.
    </para>
    
    <para>In a minimal deployment, you can create and run processes with jBPM
      by putting only the commons-logging and dom4j library in your classpath.  
      Beware that persisting processes to a database is not supported.  The 
      dom4j library can be removed if you don't use the process xml parsing, 
      but instead build your object graph programatically.

            library can be configured to dispatch the logs to e.g. 
            java 1.4 logging, log4j, ...  See 
            <ulink url="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/guide.html">
            the apache commons user guide</ulink> for more information on how 
            to configure commons logging.  if you're used to log4j, the easiest 
            way is to put the log4j lib and a log4j.properties in the classpath.
            commons logging will automatically detect this and use that configuration.

    <para>A typical deployment for jBPM will include persistent storage of 
      process definitions and process executions.  In that case, jBPM does 
      not have any dependencies outside hibernate and its dependent libraries.

    <para>Of course, hibernate's required libraries depend on the environment
      and what features you use.  For details refer to the hibernate 
      documentation.  The next table gives an indication for a plain 
      standalone POJO development environment.

      <title>Debugging a process in the suite</title>
      <para>First of all, in case you're just starting to develop a new process, 
      it is much easier to use plain JUnit tests and run the process in memory like 
      explained in <xref linkend="tutorial" />.
      </para>
      <para>But if you want to run the process in the console and debug it there
      here are the 2 steps that you need to do: 
      </para>
      <para>1) in 
      <literal>jboss-{version}/server/bin/run.bat</literal>, somewhere at the end, 
      there is a line like this:</para>
      <programlisting>rem set JAVA_OPTS=-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8787,server=y,suspend=y %JAVA_OPTS%</programlisting>
      <para>For backup reasons, just start by making a copy of that line, then remove the first '<literal>rem</literal>'
      and change <literal>suspend=y</literal> to <literal>suspend=n</literal>.  Then you get something like</para>
      <programlisting>rem set JAVA_OPTS=-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8787,server=y,suspend=y %JAVA_OPTS%
set JAVA_OPTS=-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8787,server=y,suspend=n %JAVA_OPTS%</programlisting>
      <para>2) In your IDE debug by connecting to a remote Java application on localhost on 
      port 8787.  Then you can start adding break points and run through the processes with the console
      until the breakpoint is hit.
