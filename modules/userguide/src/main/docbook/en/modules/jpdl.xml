  <title>jBPM Process Definition Language (JPDL)</title>

  <para>JPDL specifies an xml schema and the mechanism to package all the process 
  definition related files into a process archive.

    <title>The process archive</title>
    <para>A process archive is a zip file.  The central file in the process archive is 
    <literal>processdefinition.xml</literal>.  The main information in that file is 
    the process graph.  The <literal>processdefinition.xml</literal> also contains 
    information about actions and tasks.  A process archive can also contain other 
    process related files such as classes, ui-forms for tasks, ...</para>

      <title>Deploying a process archive</title>
      <para>Deploying process archives can be done in 3 ways: with the process designer tool,
      with an ant task or programatically.
      </para>
      <para>Deploying a process archive with the designer tool is supported in the starters-kit.
        Right click on the process archive folder to find the "Deploy process archive" option.
        The starters-kit server contains the jBPM web application, which has a servlet to upload 
        process archives called ProcessUploadServlet.  This servlet is capable of uploading 
        process archives and deploying them to the default jBPM instance configured.
      </para>
      <para>Deploying a process archive with an ant task can be done as follows:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;target name="deploy.par"&gt;
  &lt;taskdef name="deploypar" classname="org.jbpm.ant.DeployProcessTask"&gt;
    &lt;classpath --make sure the jbpm-[version].jar is in this classpath--/&gt;  
  &lt;/taskdef&gt;  
  &lt;deploypar par="build/myprocess.par" /&gt; 
&lt;/target&gt;</programlisting>
      <para>To deploy more process archives at once, use the nested fileset elements.
      The file attribute itself is optional.  Other attributes of the ant task are:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">cfg</emphasis>: cfg is optional, the default value 
        is 'hibernate.cfg.xml'. The hibernate configuration file that contains the jdbc 
        connection properties to the database and the mapping files.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">properties</emphasis>: properties is optional and 
        overwrites *all* hibernate properties as found in the hibernate.cfg.xml</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">createschema</emphasis>: if set to true, the jbpm 
        database schema is created before the processes get deployed.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>Process archives can also be deployed programmatically with the class 
      <literal>org.jbpm.jpdl.par.ProcessArchiveDeployer</literal> </para>

    <section id="processversioning">
      <title>Process versioning</title>
      <para>What happens when we have a process definition deployed, many executions 
      are not yet finished and we have a new version of the process definition that 
      we want to deploy ?
      </para>
      
      <para>Process instances always execute to the process definition that they are 
      started in.  But jBPM allows for multiple process definitions of 
      the same name to coexist in the database.  So typically, a process instance is 
      started in the latest version available at that time and it will keep on executing in 
      that same process definition for its complete lifetime.  When a newer version 
      is deployed, newly created instances will be started in the newest version, 
      while older process instances keep on executing in the older process
      definitions.</para>

      <para>If the process includes references to Java classes, the java classes can be 
      made available to the jBPM runtime environment in 2 ways : by making sure these 
      classes are visible to the jBPM classloader.  This usually means that you can 
      put your delegation classes in a <literal>.jar</literal> file next to the 
      <literal>jbpm-[version].jar</literal>.  In that case, all the process definitions 
      will see that same class file.  The java classes can also be included 
      in the process archive.  When you include your delegation classes in the process 
      archive (and they are not visible to the jbpm classloader), jBPM will also version 
      these classes inside the process definition.  More information about process classloading 
      can be found in <xref linkend="delegation" />
      </para>
      
      <para>When a process archive gets deployed, it creates a process definition in 
      the jBPM database.  Process definitions can be versioned on the basis of the 
      process definition name.  When a named process archive gets deployed, the deployer 
      will assign a version number.  To assign this number, the deployer will look 
      up the highest version number for process definitions with the same name and 
      adds 1.  Unnamed process definitions will always have version number -1.

        <title>Changing deployed process definitions</title>
        <para>Changing process definitions after they are deployed into the 
          jBPM database has many potential pitfalls.  Therefor, this is highly
          discouraged.
        </para>
        <para>Actually, there is a whole variety of possible changes that can 
          be made to a process definition.  Some of those process definitions 
          are harmless, but some other changes have implications far beyond the 
          expected and desirable.
        </para>
        <para>So please consider migrating 
        process instances to a new definition (see <xref linkend="migratingprocessinstances"/>)over this approach.
        </para>
        <para>In case you would consider it, these are the points to take into 
          consideration:
        </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Use Hibernate's update</emphasis>: You can 
          just load a process definition, change it and save it with the 
          hibernate session.  The hibernate session can be accessed with 
          the method <literal>JbpmContext.getSession()</literal>.
        </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The second level cache</emphasis>: A process 
          definition would need to be removed from the second level cache after 
          you've updated an existing process definition.  See also <xref linkend="secondlevelcache" />

      <section id="migratingprocessinstances">
        <title>Migrating process instances</title>
        <para>An alternative approach to changing process definitions might be 
          to convert the executions to a new process definition.  Please take 
          into account that this is not trivial due to the long-lived nature of 
          business processes.  Currently, this is an experimental area so for which 
          there are not yet much out-of-the-box support.
        </para>
        <para>As you know 
          there is a clear distinction between process definition data, process 
          instance data (the runtime data) and the logging data.  With this approach, you create a separate new process definition 
          in the jBPM database (by e.g. deploying a new version of the same 
          process).  Then the runtime information is converted to the new process 
          definition.  This might involve a translation cause tokens in the old 
          process might be pointing to nodes that have been removed in the new 
          version.  So only new data is created in the database.  But one execution of 
          a process is spread over two process instance objects.  This might 
          become a bit tricky for the tools and statistics calculations.
          When resources permit us, we are going to add support for this in the 
          future.  E.g. a pointer could be added from one process instance to 
          it's predecessor.

      <para>The jBPM class loader is the class loader that loads the jBPM classes.  
      Meaning, the classloader that has the library <literal>jbpm-3.x.jar</literal>
      in its classpath.  To make classes visible to the jBPM classloader, put them 
      in a jar file and put the jar file besides the <literal>jbpm-3.x.jar</literal>.

      <title>The process class loader</title>
      <para>Delegation classes are loaded with the process class loader of their 
      respective process definition.  The process class loader is a class loader 
      that has the jBPM classloader as a parent.  The process class loader adds all 
      the classes of one particular process definition.  You can add classes to a 
      process definition by putting them in the <literal>/classes</literal> folder 
      in the process archive. Note that this is only useful when you want to version 
      the classes that you add to the process definition.  If versioning is not necessary,

      be called on an event in the process.  Delegations are specified in the 
      <literal>processdefinition.xml</literal>.  3 pieces of data can be supplied when

      <section id="configtypefield">
        <title>config-type field</title>
        <para>This is the default configuration type. The <literal>config-type field</literal> will first instantiate an object 
        of the delegation class and then set values in the fields of the object as 
        specified in the configuration.  The configuration is xml, where the 
        element names have to correspond with the field names of the class.  The content 
        text of the element is put in the corresponding field.  If necessary and possible, 
        the content text of the element is converted to the field type.
        </para>
        <para>Supported type conversions:</para>

          this can be indicated by specifying a type attribute with the fully qualified type name.

          <listitem><para>maps.  In this case, each element of the field-element is expected to have one sub-element 
            <literal>key</literal> and one element <literal>value</literal>.  The key and element are both

              <entry>the leaving transitions.  Each leaving transitions of a
              node can have a condition.  The decision will use these conditions to look 
              for the first transition for which the condition evaluates to true.  
              The first transition represents the otherwise branch.  So first, all 
              transitions with a condition are evaluated.  If one of those evaluate to true, 
              that transition is taken.  If no transition with a condition resolves to true, 
              the default transition (=the first one) is taken.
              <!-- OOPS i wich this were true, but i think i never implemented it that way :-(
              A transition without a condition is considered to evaluate to true
              (to model the 'otherwise' branch).
