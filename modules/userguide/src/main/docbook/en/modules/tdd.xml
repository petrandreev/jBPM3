    <title>Introducing TDD for workflow</title>
    <para>Since developing process oriented software is no different from 
    developing any other software, we believe that process definitions should
    be easily testable.  This chapter shows how you can use plain JUnit without
    any extensions to unit test the process definitions that you author.</para>
    
    <para>The development cycle should be kept as short as possible.  Changes 
    made to the sources of software should be immediately verifiable.  Preferably,
    without any intermediate build steps.  The examples given below will show 
    you how to develop and test jBPM processes without intermediate steps.</para>
    
    <para>Mostly the unit tests of process definitions are execution scenarios.
    Each scenario is executed in one JUnit test method and will feed in the external 
    triggers (read: signals) into a process execution and verifies after each signal 
    if the process is in the expected state.</para>
    
    <para>Let's look at an example of such a test.  We take a simplified version of 
    the auction process with the following graphical representation:</para>
    
	  <figure id="auction.test.image">
	    <title>The auction test process</title>
	    <mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata align="center" fileref="images/auction.test.gif"/></imageobject></mediaobject>
	  </figure>
	  
    <para>Now, let's write a test that executes the main scenario:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class AuctionTest extends TestCase {

  // parse the process definition
  static ProcessDefinition auctionProcess = 
      ProcessDefinition.parseParResource("org/jbpm/tdd/auction.par");

  // get the nodes for easy asserting
  static StartState start = auctionProcess.getStartState();
  static State auction = (State) auctionProcess.getNode("auction");
  static EndState end = (EndState) auctionProcess.getNode("end");

  // the process instance
  ProcessInstance processInstance;

  // the main path of execution
  Token token;

  public void setUp() {
    // create a new process instance for the given process definition
    processInstance = new ProcessInstance(auctionProcess);

    // the main path of execution is the root token
    token = processInstance.getRootToken();
  }
  
  public void testMainScenario() {
    // after process instance creation, the main path of 
    // execution is positioned in the start state.
    assertSame(start, token.getNode());
    
    token.signal();
    
    // after the signal, the main path of execution has 
    // moved to the auction state
    assertSame(auction, token.getNode());
    
    token.signal();
    
    // after the signal, the main path of execution has 
    // moved to the end state and the process has ended
    assertSame(end, token.getNode());
    assertTrue(processInstance.hasEnded());
  }
}</programlisting>

    <title>XML sources</title>
    <para>Before you can start writing execution scenario's, you need a 
    <literal>ProcessDefinition</literal>.  The easiest way to get a 
    <literal>ProcessDefinition</literal> object is by parsing xml. If you 
    have code completion, type <literal>ProcessDefinition.parse</literal> 
    and activate code completion.  Then you get the various parsing methods.  
    There are basically 3 ways to write xml that can be parsed to a 
    <literal>ProcessDefinition</literal> object:</para>
    
    <section id="parsingaprocessarchive">
      <title>Parsing a process archive</title>
      <para>A process archive is a zip file that contains the process xml 
      in a file called <literal>processdefinition.xml</literal>.  The jBPM
      process designer reads and writes process archives. For example:</para>
      
      <programlisting language="java">static ProcessDefinition auctionProcess = 
    ProcessDefinition.parseParResource("org/jbpm/tdd/auction.par");</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section id="parsinganxmlfile">
      <title>Parsing an xml file</title>
      <para>In other situations, you might want to write the 
      processdefinition.xml file by hand and later package the zip file 
      with e.g. an ant script.  In that case, you can use the 
      <literal>JpdlXmlReader</literal></para>
      
      <programlisting language="java">static ProcessDefinition auctionProcess = 
    ProcessDefinition.parseXmlResource("org/jbpm/tdd/auction.xml");</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section id="parsinganxmlstring">
      <title>Parsing an xml String</title>
      <para>The simplest option is to parse the xml in the unit test 
      inline from a plain String.</para>
      
      <programlisting>static ProcessDefinition auctionProcess = 
    ProcessDefinition.parseXmlString(
  "&lt;process-definition>" + 
  "  &lt;start-state name='start'&gt;" + 
  "    &lt;transition to='auction'/&gt;" + 
  "  &lt;/start-state&gt;" + 
  "  &lt;state name='auction'&gt;" + 
  "    &lt;transition to='end'/&gt;" + 
  "  &lt;/state&gt;" + 
  "  &lt;end-state name='end'/&gt;" + 
  "&lt;/process-definition&gt;");
