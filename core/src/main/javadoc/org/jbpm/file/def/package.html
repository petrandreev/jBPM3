storage of binary information.

<p>In some parts of the jbpm datamodel, binary data needs to be persisted.
Soring binary data in databases is not portable.  This package provides a 
solution for that problem.
</p>

<p>This package contains 2 strategies that can be used for storing binary data:
</p>

<p>1) one mechanism is to chop the large byte array into smaller pieces of 1K.
(see package org.jbpm.bytes).
</p>

<p>2) a second mechanism is to store the large binaries in a file on the filesystem.
(see configuration property 'jbpm.files.dir')
